Because in our algorithm, _all rewards are created equal_, meaning we give equal weight to a _current reward_ (finding the exit), or a _future reward_ (finding a step that leads toward a future step that finds the exit). If we happen to move back and forth between two steps, we add any positive reward from one to the other, and back again, falsely creating a loop, and potentially amplifying the reward.\n",
